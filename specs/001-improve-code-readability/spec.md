# Feature Specification: Code Readability and GitHub Inbound Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `001-improve-code-readability`  
**Created**: 2025-10-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "clean up the code to be more readable and allow more inbound from github exposed code"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Code Cleanup for Readability (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I want the code to be cleaned up for better readability so that I can maintain and understand it more easily.

**Why this priority**: This is the core improvement requested for code quality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently through code review and linting checks.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** existing codebase, **When** reviewing code files, **Then** they exhibit consistent formatting, clear naming conventions, and appropriate documentation.
2. **Given** complex functions, **When** examining them, **Then** they are refactored for simplicity and clarity.

### User Story 2 - Enable GitHub Inbound Functionality (Priority: P2)

As a potential client or collaborator, I want to access the services from GitHub so that I can see the code style and reach the agency's services.

**Why this priority**: Secondary goal to enhance GitHub integration and showcase the agency's work.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying that GitHub users can access the services and view the code style.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the project is public on GitHub, **When** users visit from GitHub, **Then** they can reach the services and view the improved code style.
