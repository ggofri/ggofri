# Implementation Plan: Code Readability and GitHub Inbound Enhancement

**Branch**: `001-improve-code-readability` | **Date**: 2025-10-24 | **Spec**: specs/001-improve-code-readability/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-improve-code-readability/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Improve code readability through refactoring and formatting, and enable inbound access from GitHub to showcase code style and allow users to reach the agency's services.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript/JavaScript with Astro  
**Primary Dependencies**: Astro, Tailwind CSS  
**Storage**: N/A (static site)  
**Testing**: npm test && npm run lint  
**Target Platform**: Web  
**Project Type**: Web application (Astro static site)  
**Performance Goals**: Fast loading times, minimal bundle size  
**Constraints**: Responsive design, accessibility, optimize for fast loading  
**Scale/Scope**: Blog site with content-driven approach, vertical slicing for features

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Clean Code**: Feature includes code cleanup for readability, aligns with principle.
- **Simplicity**: Refactoring for clarity supports simplicity.
- **Minimal UX**: No new UI elements added, maintains minimalism.
- **Vertical Slicing**: Feature can be implemented incrementally.
- **Content-Driven**: No impact on content structure.
- **Technology Stack**: Uses existing Astro and Tailwind.
- **Performance**: Code cleanup may improve performance.
- **Workflow**: Follows git and PR process.

No violations detected. Re-checked after design: Still compliant.

**Structure Decision**: Single web application structure using Astro's src/ directory for components, pages, and content.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
