# Quickstart: Code Readability and GitHub Inbound Enhancement

## Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- Access to hosting platform (Vercel/Netlify)

## Implementation Steps

1. **Code Readability Improvements**:
   - Run `npm run lint` to identify issues
   - Refactor complex functions for simplicity
   - Add JSDoc comments to key functions
   - Ensure consistent formatting with Prettier

2. **GitHub Inbound Configuration**:
   - In hosting dashboard, whitelist GitHub IP ranges (get from https://api.github.com/meta)
   - Set up webhook for repository pushes to trigger rebuilds
   - Test inbound access by pushing a change to the repo

3. **Verification**:
   - Run `npm test && npm run lint` to ensure code quality
   - Check that site rebuilds automatically on GitHub pushes
   - Verify site is accessible and shows improved code in repo
