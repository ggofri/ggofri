# Implementation Plan: Minimal Resume Layout for Experience Page

**Branch**: `001-resume-layout` | **Date**: 2025-10-23 | **Spec**: specs/001-resume-layout/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-resume-layout/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Implement a minimal resume layout for the /experience page using MDX, focusing on simplicity, minimalism, and an essentialist, zen-like design inspired by "the quiet place at web". Support dark/light mode themes.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript/JavaScript (Astro framework)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Astro, Tailwind CSS, MDX  
**Storage**: N/A (static content from content/resume/)  
**Testing**: Vitest (for component testing) or manual testing  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers  
**Project Type**: Web application (Astro site)  
**Performance Goals**: Page load under 2 seconds  
**Constraints**: Minimal design, responsive, theme support  
**Scale/Scope**: Single page addition, static content

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Minimal UX: Design must prioritize minimalistic interface, reducing cognitive load.
- Simplicity: Favor straightforward solutions, avoid complexity.
- Clean Code: Write readable, maintainable code.
- Vertical Slicing: Deliver end-to-end functionality incrementally.
- Content-Driven Approach: Let content dictate design.

No violations anticipated; design aligns with principles.

**Structure Decision**: Single web application structure adapted to existing Astro project. Add experience.mdx to pages/, utilize existing content/resume/ for data.
