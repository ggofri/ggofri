## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View Resume on Experience Page (Priority: P1)

Visitors to the site can access the /experience page to view a professional resume showcasing the developer's background and skills.

**Independent Test**: The page can be fully tested by navigating to /experience and verifying the resume content is displayed correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a visitor navigates to /experience, **When** the page loads, **Then** a resume is displayed with a proper title.
2. **Given** the site supports dark/light mode, **When** the theme is toggled, **Then** the resume layout adapts accordingly.
3. **Given** the resume content is available, **When** the page renders, **Then** all sections (experience, education, skills) are shown in a minimal, readable format.
