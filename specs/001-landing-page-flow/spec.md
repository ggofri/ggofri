**Created**: Thu Oct 23 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "work on the landing page flow, now ggofri.com will be this same project so the flow shouldn't be redirect there but move the user within this same page, social links, and cal.com integration"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Navigate Within Landing Page (Priority: P1)
