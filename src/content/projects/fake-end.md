# fake-end

An open source, minimalist TypeScript CLI tool designed for developers to quickly prototype and mock backend APIs using intuitive YAML configuration files. Streamlines frontend development by providing realistic API responses without needing a full backend setup.

## Features

- Intuitive YAML-based API configuration
- Built-in TypeScript support for type safety
- Lightning-fast development server
- Comprehensive RESTful API mocking capabilities
- Flexible custom response scenarios and error simulation
- Zero-configuration setup for rapid prototyping

## Usage

Install globally via npm and define your mock endpoints in simple YAML files. Ideal for frontend developers working on features before backend APIs are ready, or for testing edge cases and error scenarios.

## Status

Fully open source and actively maintained. Available on NPM with regular updates driven by community contributions and feedback.
