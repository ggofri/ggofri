# My Journey

How I got here and what I've learned along the way.

## My Philosophy

My thoughts are shaped by three guiding forces: my faith in CHRIST, Amor Fati, and Essentialism. These principles teach me acceptance and resilience while making me delusional enough to keep going against anything.

## The Ordinary World

It all began 15 years ago, when I was just 10, living in Buenos Aires. Fascinated by technology's dark side, I built small malware programs on CDs and studied how people were endangered by tech risks. By 15, that curiosity blossomed into a deep love for programming. I learned bash scripts and basic Java, dreaming of the endless possibilities code could create.

## The Call to Adventure

As a teenager, the world opened up before me. I discovered marketing and writing, publishing short stories in contests while learning marketing on my own. These were the seeds that grew into my growth engineering career. I taught English and Portuguese at school, earned my taekwondo black belt at 18, and even started a martial arts gym with my brother—mixing discipline with the thrill of building businesses.

> Early ventures taught me that mastering skills creates opportunities.

## Trials and Tribulations

The path was not easy. I worked as a freelancer in web development, creating my church's first website—a humble beginning. I became the lead scriptwriter for a YouTube channel with a million subscribers and started a podcast that, well, didn't quite take off. Then the pandemic hit, ending the gym. I quit college and started a vegan ghost kitchen that actually worked well, helping my family through those hard times.

> Failure and adaptation build resilience.

## The Transformation

In 2021, I fully embraced the corporate world. From Lenovo's Windows 11 launch to Mercado Libre and Expedia, I led teams, scaled systems, and drove massive growth through innovation. I guided startups from zero to seed, and seed to Series A. But amid all the success, I yearned to build my own destiny—not just execute on others' ideas.

> Corporate experience taught me how to scale and lead at enterprise level.

## The Return

2024 was my homecoming. I started building projects again, launching Steps to guide engineers' careers, making fake end, an open source tool that solved real dev pain, and an ESLint plugin for cleaner code.

This month, I went all in on entrepreneurship, starting ggofri.com to help founders grow with experimentation.

> Now I am building torch.it.com, a site builder with experimentation built in.

## The Elixir

Now, at 25, with a decade of code and creation, I share the wisdom I earned.

Through ggofri.com, I guide founders to scale in a good way, while making indie tools that solve real problems.

My path from malware curious kid to growth architect shows that true innovation mixes technical mastery with human insight. With 10 years in tech, 10 with my wife, 2 kids, and lessons from every battle, I build not just products, but legacies.

## The Legacy

### Entrepreneurship is about solving real problems
From teaching lessons to building software, it is always about creating value.

### Growth comes from experimentation
Data driven decisions, creative marketing, and technical execution work together.

### Shipping creates learning opportunities
Build, launch, iterate. Perfection is the enemy of progress.

### Balance enables sustainability
Family, faith, and work can coexist and strengthen each other.

## Next Goals

$2k SaaS MRR by Dec 2025  
3 apps launched by January 2026

These goals are a way to keep a clear path.
