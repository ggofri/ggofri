        My thoughts are shaped by three guiding forces: my faith in Christ, Amor Fati, and Essentialism. These principles teach me
        acceptance and resilience while making me brave enough to keep going against anything.

        It all began 15 years ago, at age 10, in Buenos Aires. I was fascinated by the dark side of technology.
        I built small malware programs on CDs and studied how people were endangered by tech risks. By 15, that curiosity
        made me love programming. I learned bash scripts and basic Java, dreaming of what code could create.

        As a teenager, the world opened up. I discovered marketing and writing, publishing short stories in contests
        and learning marketing on my own. These were seeds that grew into my growth engineering career.
        I taught English and Portuguese at school, earned my taekwondo black belt at 18, and started a martial arts gym
        with my brother, mixing discipline with starting businesses.

        The path was not easy. I worked as a freelancer in web development, making my church's first website. That was a humble beginning. I became
        lead scriptwriter for a YouTube channel with a million subscribers and started a podcast that did not take off. When the
        pandemic came, it ended the gym, so I quit college and started a vegan ghost kitchen. It worked well,
        helping my family during those hard times.

        In 2021, I joined the corporate world fully. From Lenovo's Windows 11 launch to Mercado Libre and Expedia,
        I led teams, scaled systems, and drove big growth through innovation. I have guided startups from zero to seed,
        and seed to Series A. But amid the success, I wanted to build my own destiny, not just work on others' ideas.

        2024 was my homecoming. I started building projects again, launching Steps to guide engineers' careers,
        making fake end, an open source tool that solved real dev pain, and an ESLint plugin for cleaner code.
        This month, I went all in on entrepreneurship, starting ggofri.com to help founders grow with experimentation.

        kid to growth architect shows that true innovation mixes technical mastery with human insight. With 10 years
        in tech, 10 with my wife, 2 kids, and lessons from every battle, I build not just products, but legacies.
