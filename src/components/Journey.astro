         My thoughts are shaped by three guiding forces: my faith in <span style="text-transform: uppercase;">Christ</span>, Amor Fati, and Essentialism. These principles teach me
         acceptance and resilience while making me delusional enough to keep going against anything.

         It all began 15 years ago, when I was just 10, living in Buenos Aires. Fascinated by technology's dark side, I built small malware programs on CDs and studied how people were endangered by tech risks. By 15, that curiosity blossomed into a deep love for programming. I learned bash scripts and basic Java, dreaming of the endless possibilities code could create.

         As a teenager, the world opened up before me. I discovered marketing and writing, publishing short stories in contests while learning marketing on my own. These were the seeds that grew into my growth engineering career. I taught English and Portuguese at school, earned my taekwondo black belt at 18, and even started a martial arts gym with my brother—mixing discipline with the thrill of building businesses.

         The path was not easy. I worked as a freelancer in web development, creating my church's first website—a humble beginning. I became the lead scriptwriter for a YouTube channel with a million subscribers and started a podcast that, well, didn't quite take off. Then the pandemic hit, ending the gym. I quit college and started a vegan ghost kitchen that actually worked well, helping my family through those hard times.

         In 2021, I fully embraced the corporate world. From Lenovo's Windows 11 launch to Mercado Libre and Expedia, I led teams, scaled systems, and drove massive growth through innovation. I guided startups from zero to seed, and seed to Series A. But amid all the success, I yearned to build my own destiny—not just execute on others' ideas.
