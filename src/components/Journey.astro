      I didn't start out as a growth engineer. I started as someone obsessed with building things and making them
      work. That obsession led me to realize something fundamental: the best products aren't built by
      accidentâ€”they're built by people who understand both the technical side and the human side.

      Early in my career, I shipped things. I learned what it felt like to see code go from my laptop to thousands
      of people using it. That taught me something fundamental:

      The Growth Realization

    <p class="text-sm text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
      But shipping wasn't enough. I started noticing that some products grew and some didn't. It wasn't always about
      being better. It was about understanding your users, finding the right channels, and making decisions based on
      data instead of gut feel.

      The best growth comes from building something people genuinely want, then finding creative ways to reach them.
      It's the intersection of creativity and rigor. Too many companies choose one or the other. I've spent my
      career proving you need both.
