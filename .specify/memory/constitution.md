# ggofri-blog Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Minimal UX
Prioritize minimalistic user interfaces that focus on essential functionality, reducing cognitive load and enhancing usability. Avoid unnecessary elements, ensuring every component serves a clear purpose.

### II. Simplicity
Strive for simplicity in design, code, and processes. Eliminate complexity where possible, favoring straightforward solutions that are easy to understand and maintain.

### III. Clean Code
Write clean, readable, and maintainable code. Follow best practices for naming, structure, and documentation to ensure code is self-explanatory and easy to modify.

### IV. Vertical Slicing
Develop features through vertical slices, delivering end-to-end functionality incrementally. This approach ensures that each slice provides value and allows for early feedback and testing.

### V. Content-Driven Approach
Let content dictate the design and structure. Prioritize content creation and organization, ensuring that the platform adapts to the content rather than forcing content into rigid structures.

## Additional Constraints

Technology stack: Astro, Tailwind CSS. Ensure responsive design and accessibility. Performance: Optimize for fast loading times and minimal bundle size.

## Development Workflow

Use git for version control with semantic commits. Follow vertical slicing for feature development. Review PRs for compliance with principles. Deploy via Vercel or similar.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other practices. Amendments require consensus and documentation. All changes must verify compliance with core principles. Use this constitution for runtime development guidance.
