## senior software engineer

my philosophy is treat every problem as a **puzzle**. this allowed me to easily **divide** and joyfully **conquer**.

> i'm based in _buenos aires, argentina_. if you're here and want to chat ping me and let's drink mate 🧉

**⚙️ focused on:** platform software & developer experience

**🧱 currently building:** _ficus_ → platform for **reliable** key backend migrations
