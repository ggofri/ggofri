### ⚡ Meeting me in less than 5 minutes:
- I'm a developer who loves the __productivity__, I'm passionate about learning new __languages__ and communicate with foreigns in their own way.
- In my personal computer, I always prefer to use __Linux__ as SO (Arch and derivatives 🐧) and to code I use __NeoVim__.
- What have I done before learning code? I was interested in __Marketing__ and (this is a kind of _walkthrough_) this guide me to learn about __design__ ('cause I wanted to know what guide people to __interact__ with websites), and, at the end, the design let me know that my true passion was (and is) to __code__.
- My hobbies are __creative writing__, __creative challenges__ (in __CSS__ above all) and __logical debates__ (yes, I love that 😆)
